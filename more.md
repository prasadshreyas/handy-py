To use `log.debug` in Python, you first need to import the `logging` module and configure it. Here's an example of how to use `log.debug` in your code:

```python
import logging

# Configure the logging module
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Create a logger object
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Use log.debug to log a debug message
log.debug("This is a debug message")

# Other logging levels
log.info("This is an info message")
log.warning("This is a warning message")
log.error("This is an error message")
log.critical("This is a critical message")
```

In this example, we first import the `logging` module and configure its logging level to `logging.DEBUG`. This means that messages with a level of `DEBUG` or higher will be displayed.

We then create a logger object using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. The `__name__` argument allows us to associate the logger with the current module.

Finally, we use the `log.debug()` method to log a debug message. Other logging levels, such as `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical`, can be used similarly with their respective methods.

Keep in mind that the log messages will be displayed in the console by default. If you want to log messages to a file, you can configure the logging module like this:

```python
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG)
```

This will log messages to a file named `example.log` instead of displaying them in the console.

In Jupyter notebooks, using `exit()` or `quit()` is not recommended, as it raises a `SystemExit` exception and may cause unintended behavior. Instead, you can use `raise` and `SystemExit` to control the flow of your code execution.

**`raise` Exception:**

Use the `raise` keyword followed by an exception type to raise an exception. This can be helpful for debugging purposes or to stop the execution of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook.

```python
# Example:

print("This line will be executed.")
raise Exception("An error occurred!")
print("This line will not be executed.")
```

**`SystemExit`:**

The `SystemExit` exception can be used to stop the execution of the current cell in a Jupyter notebook. When `SystemExit` is encountered, the notebook will stop executing the current cell and move on to the next one.

```python
# Example:

print("This line will be executed.")
raise SystemExit
print("This line will not be executed.")
```
