To use `log.debug` in Python, you first need to import the `logging` module and configure it. Here's an example of how to use `log.debug` in your code:

```python
import logging

# Configure the logging module
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Create a logger object
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Use log.debug to log a debug message
log.debug("This is a debug message")

# Other logging levels
log.info("This is an info message")
log.warning("This is a warning message")
log.error("This is an error message")
log.critical("This is a critical message")
```

In this example, we first import the `logging` module and configure its logging level to `logging.DEBUG`. This means that messages with a level of `DEBUG` or higher will be displayed.

We then create a logger object using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. The `__name__` argument allows us to associate the logger with the current module.

Finally, we use the `log.debug()` method to log a debug message. Other logging levels, such as `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical`, can be used similarly with their respective methods.

Keep in mind that the log messages will be displayed in the console by default. If you want to log messages to a file, you can configure the logging module like this:

```python
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG)
```

This will log messages to a file named `example.log` instead of displaying them in the console.
